tensorflow installation so I never have to figure this out again. quite annoying but still less of a headache than rocm.
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-723/install-guide/index.html#installing-pip
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/CUDA
https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration

tf only supports ubuntu officially but getting it on fedora isn't that much harder, on a fresh fedora install need to get the rpm free/nonfree packages to get CUDA:
https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration
sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

then to get cuda
https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/CUDA
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/fedora35/x86_64/cuda-fedora35.repo
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf module disable nvidia-driver
sudo dnf -y install cuda

I think you need to restart terminal/machine for the drivers to go into effect, but hopefully nvidia-smi works if you were to run it after the fact. then follow gpu instructions on tf page:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/' > $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0

this stuff is all on the tf install page, but there are things with nvidia-tensorrt and bashrc that need to be done
tensorrt
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-723/install-guide/index.html#installing-pip

I feel like I installed some sort of nvidia machine learning repo as well from rpm

echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorrt/' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh

the link I just realized has a work around if your cuda version is later than the tensorflow that you have (downloads libnvinfer8 but expects 7).
having done this before on a cluster it isn't just libnvinfer that causes problems
you can downgrade (step 4 of 4.3.1.Â Using The NVIDIA Machine Learning Network Repo For RPM Installation) or create a symbolic link between 7 and 8 which will work just fine


ln -s /home/christian/miniconda3/envs/tf/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorrt/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8 /home/christian/miniconda3/envs/tf/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorrt/libnvinfer_plugin.so.7

I also had to add this to my .bashrc
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74956134/could-not-load-dynamic-library-libnvinfer-so-7

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/christian/miniconda3/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/christian/miniconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorrt/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/christian/miniconda3/envs/tf/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/christian/miniconda3/envs/tf/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorrt/

can check that it has worked with:

python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.test.is_gpu_available(cuda_only=True))"
